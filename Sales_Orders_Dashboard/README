# Sales Orders Analysis – Power BI

## Business Problem
The sales management team needs a comprehensive dashboard to analyze sales
performance, product trends, and territory contribution. The objective is to
provide clear insights into total sales, quantities sold, average order value,
and performance across product categories and regions to support data-driven
decision making.
